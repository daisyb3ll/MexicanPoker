These Are the Coding Standards!!

Use meaningful variable and function names.
Write clear and concise comments where necessary.
Before each function, comment a brief description of the function
Avoid redundant or unnecessary code please!
Keep the codebase clean and organized.
Class names should use the camelCase;  for example, "red crayon" would be redCrayon
Functions, variables, and attributes should be in lowercase, with words separated by underscores: my_variable.
