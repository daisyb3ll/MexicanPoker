# MexicanPoker
welcome to mexican poker, just like Texas Holdem- but not boring! 

The rule to Mexican Poker are very similar to regular poker. 

~~ CARDS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To start, poker is a card game- we use cards. Poker is played with a deck of 52 cards. 
The deck of 52 cards has four different suits. Suits are the symbols on the cards. 
    SPADES = "♠"
    HEARTS = "♥"
    DIAMONDS = "♦"
    CLUBS = "♣"
There is no rank order to these suits. 

Cards in the deck range from 2-10, and then JACK,QUEEN,KING, and ACE.
A deck of cards includes 13 ranks of each suit with reversible "court" or face cards. 
    Two = 2
    Three =3
    Four =4
    Five = 5
    Six = 6
    Seven = 7
    Eight = 8
    Nine = 9
    Ten = 10 
    !!!! and then we remix here by adding the face/court cards !!!!
    JACK = 11
    QUEEN = 12 
    KING = 12 
    ACE = 13
